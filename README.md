<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Sandy</h1>

Ever since I got curious about how apps, games, and tech work, I knew I wanted to become more than just a user — I want to be a builder. That’s why I’m diving deep into the world of programming, starting with Python, and preparing myself for a future in Informatics Engineering.
